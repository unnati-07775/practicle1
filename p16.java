/**A bank wants to offer a facility to calculate EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) for 
different types of loans. Design a class LoanCalculator with the following overloaded 
methods: 
calculateEMI(int principal, int time, float rate): For home loans 
calculateEMI(double principal, int time, double rate): For vehicle loans 
calculateEMI(int principal, int time): For short-term personal loans with a fixed interest 
rate of 10% 
Demonstrate the use of all three methods in the main method by calculating EMIs for 
different loan types.*/
